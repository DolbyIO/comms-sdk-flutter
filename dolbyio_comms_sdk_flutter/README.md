# Flutter SDK

ðŸš€ SDK Beta

The Flutter SDK is a part of the [Beta Program](https://docs.dolby.io/communications-apis/docs/overview-beta-programs).

Dolby.io Communications SDK for Flutter allows creating high-quality applications for video conferencing using the [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) UI development SDK. With Flutter, you can write a single codebase in [Dart](https://dart.dev/) that you can natively compile and use for building, testing, and deploying applications across multiple platforms. Currently, the Flutter SDK supports creating applications for iOS and Android devices. On Android, the SDK offers the same [functionalities](https://docs.dolby.io/communications-apis/docs/overview-introduction) that are available in the Android SDK. On iOS, the Flutter SDK allows creating, joining, and recording basic conferences as well as managing media devices. More functionalities will be available for iOS devices in future releases.
