# Flutter SDK

ðŸš€ SDK Beta

The Flutter SDK is a part of the [Beta Program](https://docs.dolby.io/communications-apis/docs/overview-beta-programs).

Dolby.io Communications SDK for Flutter allows creating high-quality applications for video conferencing using the [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) UI development SDK. With Flutter, you can write a single codebase in [Dart](https://dart.dev/) that you can natively compile and use for building, testing, and deploying applications across multiple platforms. Currently, the Flutter SDK supports creating applications for iOS and Android devices. The SDK offers the same [functionalities](https://docs.dolby.io/communications-apis/docs/overview-introduction) that are available in Android and iOS SDK. The only exception is that the file presentation functionality is currently supported only on Android devices.
