## 3.8.2-beta.1

### Bug Fixes

Introduced improvements that help the [VideoViewController](https://api-references.dolby.io/comms-sdk-flutter/dolbyio_comms_sdk_flutter/VideoViewController-class.html) to correctly access an unmounted [VideoView](https://api-references.dolby.io/comms-sdk-flutter/dolbyio_comms_sdk_flutter/VideoView-class.html) widget.

## 3.8.1

### Features

Introduced new methods and event handlers to the [NotificationService](https://api-references.dolby.io/comms-sdk-flutter/dolbyio_comms_sdk_flutter/NotificationService-class.html) that allow participants to [subscribe](https://api-references.dolby.io/comms-sdk-flutter/dolbyio_comms_sdk_flutter/NotificationService/subscribe.html) to and [unsubscribe](https://api-references.dolby.io/comms-sdk-flutter/dolbyio_comms_sdk_flutter/NotificationService/unsubscribe.html) from the preferred notifications.

## 3.8.1-beta.1

### Features

Introduced new methods and event handlers to the [NotificationService](https://api-references.dolby.io/comms-sdk-flutter/dolbyio_comms_sdk_flutter/NotificationService-class.html) that allow participants to [subscribe](https://api-references.dolby.io/comms-sdk-flutter/dolbyio_comms_sdk_flutter/NotificationService/subscribe.html) to and [unsubscribe](https://api-references.dolby.io/comms-sdk-flutter/dolbyio_comms_sdk_flutter/NotificationService/unsubscribe.html) from the preferred notifications.

## 3.8.0

### Features

Upgraded the WebRTC version to a recent version that contains improvements and bug fixes. The previously used version contains serious security vulnerabilities that can make your application susceptible to remote code execution, and can potentially give an attacker access to your applicationâ€™s private data.

## 3.7.0

### Features

- Introduced a low noise reduction level available via a new [low](https://api-references.dolby.io/comms-sdk-flutter/dolbyio_comms_sdk_flutter/NoiseReduction.html#low) noise reduction setting. The existing [high](https://api-references.dolby.io/comms-sdk-flutter/dolbyio_comms_sdk_flutter/NoiseReduction.html#high) setting causes aggressive removal of background sounds from the captured audio. The [low](https://api-references.dolby.io/comms-sdk-flutter/dolbyio_comms_sdk_flutter/NoiseReduction.html#low) setting removes only stationary sounds, such as the sound of a computer fan, air conditioning, or microphone hum, and allows sending more ambient audio into a conference. This mode gives participants full context of other participants' environments and creates a more realistic audio experience. Setting the preferred [noise reduction](https://api-references.dolby.io/comms-sdk-flutter/dolbyio_comms_sdk_flutter/NoiseReduction.html) level and [audio capture mode](https://api-references.dolby.io/comms-sdk-flutter/dolbyio_comms_sdk_flutter/AudioCaptureMode.html) is available via a new [setCaptureMode](https://api-references.dolby.io/comms-sdk-flutter/dolbyio_comms_sdk_flutter/LocalAudio.html#setCaptureMode) method.

- Introduced DNN-based Noise Reduction (DNR) that improves voice clarity by reducing echo and background noises, such as keyboard typing noises and breathing sounds. This feature is based on a deep neural network and offers improved noise reduction to make virtual meetings more productive and pleasant.

- Introduced the [AudioService](https://api-references.dolby.io/comms-sdk-flutter/dolbyio_comms_sdk_flutter/AudioService-class.html), where the available APIs are divided into two models available via the AudioService: [LocalAudio](https://api-references.dolby.io/comms-sdk-flutter/dolbyio_comms_sdk_flutter/LocalAudio-class.html) and [RemoteAudio](https://api-references.dolby.io/comms-sdk-flutter/dolbyio_comms_sdk_flutter/RemoteAudio-class.html). The [LocalAudio](https://api-references.dolby.io/comms-sdk-flutter/dolbyio_comms_sdk_flutter/LocalAudio-class.html) model offers APIs that allow the local participant to start and stop sending audio to a conference, set capture mode, and set comfort noise level. The [RemoteAudio](https://api-references.dolby.io/comms-sdk-flutter/dolbyio_comms_sdk_flutter/RemoteAudio-class.html) model allows the local participant to stop receiving audio from selected remote participants.

- Introduced the [VideoService](https://api-references.dolby.io/comms-sdk-flutter/dolbyio_comms_sdk_flutter/VideoService-class.html), where the available APIs are divided into two models available via the VideoService: [LocalVideo](https://api-references.dolby.io/comms-sdk-flutter/dolbyio_comms_sdk_flutter/LocalVideo-class.html) and [RemoteVideo](https://api-references.dolby.io/comms-sdk-flutter/dolbyio_comms_sdk_flutter/RemoteVideo-class.html). The [LocalVideo](https://api-references.dolby.io/comms-sdk-flutter/dolbyio_comms_sdk_flutter/LocalVideo-class.html) model offers APIs that allow the local participant to start and stop sending video to a conference. The [RemoteVideo](https://api-references.dolby.io/comms-sdk-flutter/dolbyio_comms_sdk_flutter/RemoteVideo-class.html) model allows the local participant to stop receiving video streams from selected remote participants.

- Increased the [maximum number of video streams](https://api-references.dolby.io/comms-sdk-flutter/dolbyio_comms_sdk_flutter/ConferenceService/setVideoForwarding.html) that may be transmitted to the local participant to 25.

- Fixed a crash that occurred when accessing the current recording.
- Fixed an issue with converting files on iOS devices.
- Fixed an issue with receiving events from the [FilePresentationService](./lib/src/sdk_api/file_presentation_service.dart) and [VideoPresentationService](./lib/src/sdk_api/video_presentation_service.dart) on iOS devices.
- Added an option to switch speakers on Android devices.
- Unified error messages on iOS and Android devices.

## 3.6.0-beta.3

### Bug fixes:
